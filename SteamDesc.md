[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This is a fork of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813104049]Vassals Expanded and Reworked mod by lpslucasps[/url]. Most of the effects and the way everything works is the same as in the original, so please see the original's description for more info. I outline new features below.


[hr][/hr]

[h1]New Features:[/h1]

- All of the subject interaction features of the mod are handled through a new edict: Manage Subject States

- You can change your subject's name. To do this, I made it so your subject name will change to the name of your Capital system. You can easily rename your capital system, and so, you can easily rename your subjects.

- You can change the authority type of your subject states.

- You can change the capital location of your subject states.

- You can install your own heir or leaders as the rulers of subject states.

- You can give subjects all of the technology that you have researched.

- Taxes can be more fine-tuned, with separate tax options for each resource, and 5% increments.

--

- Subjects will now get an impact to the stability of their planets and their faction happiness every time something is changed. This is to represent the populace's feeling of resentment at foreign intervention. Loyal subjects will have a lower stability hit, for less time. These effects will not apply for the first two times you change their name/subject type, or the first time you change their authority.

- Subject will now occasionally ask or demand to be released from vassalage. They will rarely ask (and never demand) if they are loyal, but will become increasingly likely to ask/demand the more disloyal they are. If you deny them from being released, there is a chance an independence war will break out. If you deny them when they demand it, an independence war will break out.

- If you have my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434790082]Civil Wars mod[/url] installed, Subjects may also ask/demand to be made into Autonomous States, with all the same effects.

--

- There is a new Casus Belli and War Goal to go to war to steal another nation's subject if the subject is neighboring you. If you win the war, you will be prompted to install a new leader in the subject nation (as this is how it has been done historically, think Rome and Parthia).

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- Regular Empires can choose from any of the available Subject Types.

- Megacorp Empires can choose from any of the available megacorp Subject Types.

- You may only have one Blood Tributary/Debtor, and need the appropriate Civic for each. Indentured Servants for Debtors, and either Slaver Guilds or Barbaric Despoilers for the Blood Tributary.

- If  you have more than 10 subjects and want to change a subject's type, you may have to refresh the edict a few times to get it to appear on the list.
