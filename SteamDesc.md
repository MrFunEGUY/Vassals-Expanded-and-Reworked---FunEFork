[h1]Short Description:[/h1]

- This is a fork of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813104049]Vassals Expanded and Reworked mod by lpslucasps[/url].


[hr][/hr]

[h1]New Contract Terms:[/h1]

- Ruler Designation: Determines whether or not the Overlord can change the subject's ruler. Limited Designation allows the Overlord to choose from amongst the subject's leaders, while Unrestricted Designation allows the Overlord to choose from their own ruler's as well.

- Government Restructuring: Determines whether or not the Overlord can change the subject's government authority (Democratic, Imperial, etc.).

- Capital Relocation: Determines whether the Overlord can relocate the capital of their subject.

- Naming Rights: Determines whether the overlord is allowed to rename their subject.

[h1]Other Features:[/h1]

- All of the subject interaction features of the mod are handled through a new edict: Manage Subject States.

- Changing your subject's name: To do this, I made it so your subject name will change to the name of your Capital system. You can easily rename your capital system, and so, you can easily rename your subjects.

- You can give subjects all of the technology that you have researched.

- Taxes can be more fine-tuned, with separate tax options for each resource, and 5% increments.

- New Casus Belli and War Goal to take another empire's subject if they border you. Think Rome and Parthia fighting over Armenia.

--

- Subjects will now get an impact to the stability of their planets and their faction happiness every time something is changed. This is to represent the populace's feeling of resentment at foreign intervention. Loyal subjects will have a lower stability hit, for less time. These effects will not apply for the first two times you change their name/subject type, or the first time you change their authority.

--

- There is a new Casus Belli and War Goal to go to war to steal another nation's subject if the subject is neighboring you. If you win the war, you will be prompted to install a new leader in the subject nation (as this is how it has been done historically, think Rome and Parthia).

[h1]Notes:[/h1]

- If using my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434790082]Civil Wars[/url] mod, place this mod after it in the load order.

- For the best experience, you should use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1623423360]UI Overhaul Dynamic.[/url] It makes the negotiation screen larger, which is very nice with the newly added terms. It is used for the screenshots.

- Regular Empires can choose from any of the available Subject Types.

- Megacorp Empires can choose from any of the available megacorp Subject Types.

- You may only have one Blood Tributary/Debtor, and need the appropriate Civic for each. Indentured Servants for Debtors, and either Slaver Guilds or Barbaric Despoilers for the Blood Tributary.

- If  you have more than 10 subjects and want to change a subject's type, you may have to refresh the edict a few times to get it to appear on the list.
